# THUNDER SAK

This project is a simple web page I made for a friends band. 

## Reason for Creation

* Thunder Sak didn't have a web page. I figured I'd make one for them as practice.  
* This page is used for implementing new designs and techniques inspired from other sites. While I don't plan on making changes often, it may have significant changes from time to time.

## Usage
